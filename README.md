## Title  
Assessing Equitable Access to Green Space and Tree Canopy Cover in Calgary from the Perspective of Environmental and Human Health  
## Project Overview  
This project examines how access to green spaces and tree canopy cover vary between Calgary communities.  
The goal is to determine whether higher-income neighbourhoods have more equitable access to parks and tree canopy coverage than lower-income neighbourhoods.  
## Data Sources  
City of Calgary Open Data Portal – parks, pathway networks, ArcGIS Online - road networks, federal census income data, tree canopy coverage.  
## Methods  
1. Merged and clipped road and park pathway networks to Calgary residential communities
2. Conducted a Service Area Analaysis for a metric of 1250m (15-minute walk) from green spaces
3. Compared Median Income and Tree Canopy coverage to Service Area polygons
4. Selected individual communities to conduct a percentage of access to green spaces based on varying median income
