## Title  
Assessing Equitable Access to Green Space and Tree Canopy Cover in Calgary from the Perspective of Environmental and Human Health  
## Project Overview  
This project examines how access to green spaces and tree canopy cover vary between Calgary communities.  
The goal is to determine whether higher-income neighbourhoods have more equitable access to parks and tree canopy coverage than lower-income neighbourhoods.  
## Data Sources  
City of Calgary Open Data Portal – parks, pathway networks, tree canopy, ArcGIS Online;  
Statistics Canada – census tracts, demographic data (Median Household before-tax income in 2020)  
## Methods  
1. Clipped and merged parks and roads to each community  
2. Used Network Analysis tool to measure walkability (800 m or a 10-minute walk) to green spaces  
3. Compared results to median income data  
4. Mapped tree canopy cover for each community  
## Coordinate System
